// Meanings
val meaningFool : String = """Mostly a young man is depicted, who goes his way carefree and exhilarated.
	|This card stands for carelessness and a carefree person.
	|The meaning of this Tarot card can be positive in the sense of lightness.
	|Depending on which other cards in the card picture are connected with it, it can also stand for failure, lack of effort or seriousness.""".trimMargin()
val meaningMagician : String = """The Magician is a very popular card because it is a very spiritual and powerful figure that signifies success and implementation.
	|This tarot card signifies self-knowledge, knowledge and creative power. The magician understands the principles of life and knows how to apply them.
	|It is a card of perfection, but can also stand for a person who is (too) aware of his powers and abilities and is arrogant as a result.""".trimMargin()
val meaningHighPriestess : String = """The tarot card High Priestess stands for the female power per se, thus it is a powerful female card.
	|The High Priestess derives her power from her intuitive abilities and the gift of seeing behind or through the veil (with which she is usually depicted).
	|She is a knowing woman who can make decisions and see through things.""".trimMargin()
val meaningEmpress : String = """The empress is a very positive tarot card of abundance, maturity and completion.
	|It stands for fertility and drawing from the full.
	|In addition, this card has a maternal dimension, along with great strength.
	|Just as with the Magician, the meaning of this Tarot card can also go into the negative, denoting a person who exploits his power.
	|Just like the High Priestess cards, this is a card that stands strongly for the theme of femininity - here especially in connection with worldly themes.""".trimMargin()
val meaningEmperor : String = """The Tarot card meaning of the fifth card revolves around domination, power, control and responsibility.
	|It is a very matter-of-fact and straightforward card that means directing, leading and responsibility.
	|Depending on how it relates to the other tarot cards, it can also mean a respected person.""".trimMargin()
val meaningHierophant : String = """The hierophant stands for the divine will on earth and thus for meaning, truth and the laws of life.
	|This means one's own convictions and values, but also general questions of meaning.
	|Whether spiritual or worldly: the hierophant covers both areas.
	|But since no one has to blindly follow a higher power, this Tarot card can also be a warning to question role models and to answer questions of meaning for oneself.
	|In relationships, this card can mean that one person is superior to the other - or rises above them.""".trimMargin()
val meaningLovers : String = """Here the Tarot card meaning is quite clear, because this card is about love and the connection between people.
	|It doesn't always have to be an erotic, romantic or loving relationship; this tarot card also covers harmonious friendships, partnerships or other connections.
	|And last but not least:
	|Belonging, affection and the importance of the heart are also represented by this card.""".trimMargin()
val meaningCarriage : String = """This tarot card is nothing less than the arriving triumphal chariot - however, only the context when laying the cards reveals what exactly it means.
	|Is the chariot already on the home stretch, is it just approaching or is the journey just beginning?
	|Then it is also important to pay attention to the right direction.
	|But either way:
	|this tarot card stands for movement, development and opportunities.""".trimMargin()
val meaningJustice : String = """This tarot card stands for justice, balance and truth - and thus also for honesty.
	|There is no getting around the truth.
	|This card can therefore give hope or also be a warning,
	|because for a lack of justice a balance is necessary, which can also be a punishment.""".trimMargin()
val meaningHermit : String = """The hermit is a person who withdraws from the world and embarks on an inner journey.
	|He can appear aloof and also unfriendly to other people if his withdrawal is a result of emotional injuries or disappointments.
	|But he can also be driven by the search for truth, further development and inner growth.
	|This card embodies inner contemplation, a strong personality and spiritual insights and stands for going one's own way.""".trimMargin()
val meaningWheelOfDestinity : String = """The "Wheel of Destiny" is the card of fate in the Tarot.
	|When interpreting the card picture, special attention should be paid to it.
	|This card stands for the eternal cycle of life and also karmic patterns.
	|When reading the card, it points to a theme or situation of central importance.
	|What must not be forgotten with this card:
	|Karma can also be changed, because you can and must always set the taxes yourself.""".trimMargin()
val meaningForce : String = """This positive Tarot card denotes courage, personal strength and also the prospect of success when fighting for something.
	|It can be a good indication of where it is worth spending energy or having confidence.
	|This tarot card by itself does not stand for an aggressive force, but for inner strength and courage.""".trimMargin()
val meaningHangedMan : String = """This card often causes fright because a strong negative meaning is assumed.
	|The hanged man can be associated with punishment and torment, but it can also mean transformation and change.
	|This Tarot card always means a break, but this can also be an advantage.
	|Patience, inner peace and acceptance are good advisors for surviving crises and emerging from them as a new person.""".trimMargin()
val meaningDeath : String = """This tarot card can also cause fright and sadness, because it means the end of something.
	|However, it does not mean the physical death of a person, but primarily a detachment, a letting go, an end or a stop.
	|Every ending brings with it the start of something new, so this tarot card is by no means negative.
	|Change can take place on all levels - the surrounding cards provide information about what this change refers to.""".trimMargin()
val meaningTemperance : String = """The Tarot card meaning of â€žtemperance" lies in its function as a gentle advisor:
	|Take it slow, have an alert mind and pay attention to the appropriate proportions.
	|Less is sometimes more, and weighing both sides can help you make a wise decision.
	|This card decelerates and lets you take a step back.""".trimMargin()
val meaningDevil : String = """This card is a helpful warning because it points to blockages, obstacles or difficulties.
	|A person who cannot be trusted can also be meant.
	|This Tarot card points out to be careful - also with regard to one's own behaviour.
	|There is no light without shadow, and so it is in life.""".trimMargin()
val meaningTower : String = """The tower is a warning card because it can mean destruction, fall and catastrophe.
	|But the card can also indicate somewhat more harmlessly that a retreat has taken place or that there is a kind of (inner) "imprisonment".
	|Either way, it is a card that indicates cuts and encourages one to think about the way out in order to continue anew and strengthened.""".trimMargin()
val meaningStar : String = """This tarot card has a very beautiful meaning, because it stands for fulfilment, beauty and luck.
	|An absolute luck card, therefore, which indicates good success and blessings.
	|A star of hope, a star that guides:
	|With this tarot card there is a good omen at your side.""".trimMargin()
val meaningMoon : String = """The moon stands for the unconscious, inner contemplation, intuition and close contact with one's own consciousness.
	|At night, when everything comes to rest, the essential lies open and is illuminated by its light.
	|A tarot card that addresses the contact to one's own soul and asks to deal with one's own thoughts, feelings and mental processes.
	|A card of peace and devotion that encourages you to face difficult issues that are part of the whole.""".trimMargin()
val meaningSun : String = """A positive, strong card that signifies luck and good fortune.
	|The sun is the giver of light and warmth and the epitome of vitality.
	|A card full of energy, creative power and perfection.
	|An indication of good success and light - inside and out.""".trimMargin()
val meaningCourt : String = """The Tarot card meaning of "judgement" indicates to examine things (or oneself) carefully.
	|What is right, what is to be done?
	|At the same time, the card can indicate that a matter is coming to a conclusion.
	|It therefore also stands very strongly for closure and clear cuts.
	|Honesty, reason and objectivity are often the best advisors to bring something to a clear end and then to be able to start anew.""".trimMargin()
val meaningWorld : String = """This tarot card means completion, success and everything that lasts.
	|It stands for solidity, realisation and arrival.
	|The tarot card of the world also stands for adulthood, maturity and the view of the big picture.
	|Therefore, this card can also be a hint to look at problems with a little distance in order to recognise the essential.""".trimMargin()
